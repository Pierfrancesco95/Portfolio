In this project I analyzed videogames sales using the **Kaggle dataset** downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). You can also find the dataset as csv file in the "csv" folder of this repository.

For convenience, I recapped the main information in the dataset:
- ***Name*** --> the videogame name, it could have duplicate because same videogame are cross platforms;
- ***Platforms*** --> the videogame platform

So first I imported the dataset and trasformed the data via Power BI. Then I made a visual presentation divided by the following dashboards:
- Overall
- 6th Generation (PS2, GameCube, Xbox)
- 7th Generation (PS3, Wii, Xbox360)
- 8th Generation (PS4, WiiU, XboxOne)
- Generations camparison
