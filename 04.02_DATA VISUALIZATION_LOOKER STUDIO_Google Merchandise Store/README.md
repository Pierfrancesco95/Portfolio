# User Analysis - Google Merchandise Store

The goal of this project is to make a Dashboard using Looker Studio to show some useful business insights about "Google Merchandise Store" database.

In particular, I decided to focus the analysis on users (who they are, where they are and how they change during the time). First, I connected the database using as source GA4 website ("Google Analytics 4").

The Google Merchandise Store is an ecommerce site that sells Google-branded merchandise. 

Here the link to Google Analytics website:

Here the link to the dashboard I made in Looker Studio:

For convenience, you could also visualize the dashboard in the pdf version saved in this repository.
