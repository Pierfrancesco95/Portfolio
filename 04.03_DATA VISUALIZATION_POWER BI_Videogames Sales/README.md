In this project I analyzed videogames sales using the **Kaggle dataset** downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). You can also find the dataset as csv file in the "csv" folder of this repository.

For convenience, I recapped the main information in the dataset:
- ***Name*** --> the videogame name, it could have duplicate because some videogame are cross platforms;
- ***Platforms*** --> the platform where the videogame can be played;
- ***Year_of_Release*** --> the year when the videogame was realesed;
- ***Genre*** --> the videogame type;
- ***Publisher*** --> who published the videogame;
- ***Developer*** --> who developed the videogame;
- ***NA_sales, UE_sales, JP_sales, Other_sales*** --> the videogame sales in North America, Europe, Japan, Other regions;
- ***Global_sales*** --> the videogame sales worldwide;
- ***Critic_Score, Critic_count*** --> the vote that Critics assigned to the videogame (from 0 to 100) and how many Critics voted;
- ***User_Score, User_count*** --> the vote that Users assigned to the videogame (from 0 to 10) and how many Users voted;
- ***Rating*** --> The [ESRB ratings](https://www.esrb.org/).

So first I imported the dataset and trasformed the data via Power BI. Then I made a visual presentation divided by the following dashboards:
- Overall
- 6th Generation (PS2, GameCube, Xbox)
- 7th Generation (PS3, Wii, Xbox360)
- 8th Generation (PS4, WiiU, XboxOne)
- Generations camparison

## Abstract

In this project I analizye videogames sale of the 3 main console generations that are most recent at the date of the analysis (2023). They are 6h generation, 7th generation and 8th generation. For these generations of console I decide to considered only the not-portable console so that the analysis findings could be homogeneous. Also, in order of that, the console choosed are of the main company in the industry (Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft). These platforms are: 
- Playstation 2, GameCube, Xbox;
- Playstation 3, Wii, Xbox 360;
- Playstation 4, WiiU, Xbox One.
  
Frist I made a general overall analysis about the global sales of videogames all times. Then for each generation in scope I compared platforms global sales, the global sales trend by the year of release, the composition of global sales in the main regions, how videogame genres performed and the top videogame by global sales in the generation. Finally I compared the three generations in scope to find who is the better in global sales.

#### Limitations
One big limitation in the analysis is about the 8th generation data. Because, as it is showed in the chart at the beginning, the 8th generation is still supported and the data avaible are at 2016. 

## Overall

##  6th Generation (PS2, GameCube, Xbox)

## 7th Generation (PS3, Wii, Xbox360)
