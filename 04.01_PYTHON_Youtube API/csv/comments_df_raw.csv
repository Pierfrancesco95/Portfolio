I talk about this all the time with my closest friends.', ""My problem with learning something is that i'm a student in an uni, but the subjects that i learn are not correlate with something i'm chasing. I'm strongly interested in data science, because my mind works in a way that i process and analyse information and i see everything in my life as an information that i need to analyse, process, and make my decisions based on conclusions that i come to after analysing. But. In the uni, although it's connected to programming, and now i'm quite capable of learning anything, no matter how complex subject is, but i get stuck on a wall of why's and not finding answers. So as a result, i'm a mediocre student, that passes tests just to pass them and not having any problems with my university. \n\nI now, that, if i'm interested, i get to be very submerged into what is interested to me. I was able to learn drawing, palying instrument, or learn to play sport games in quite a short time, but when it gets to learn something that i don't see as interesting to me, no matter how hard i would try, i understand that i will have to burn myself out in order to learn something that i just can't see useful for me anyhow in the future. And i try to find answers for how that would be useful for me, but i fail. \n\nAnd now that i gave up on trying to become a good student, that knows things that won't really be useful to me, i want to focus on something that no matter of if i have a degree or not, i know that i will be able to play on the skills that i learn myself. So for now the main question for me is in building that study path, where i can get the necessary things that will pay off in the future. Like, where can i find topics for my personal projects, where can i get experience for what i myself really want to learn. Will the courses that i have on the internet really be useful for me in the future. \n\nTo conclude this, i found out that i'm not good at studying actively, but good at studying passively. Like, it's very easy for me to get burnout if my study is percieved for myself as something that i NEED to spend time, focus on that, isolate myself from other things for the particular amount of time. But. When i can ease myself from these walls that i build myself and if i can just implement Passive learning of something, for example, through simple videos like yours when i watch YouTube, just get to be on the flow with my pure curiosity of things, this exact interest, that gets me to deep no matter how down, is just building on itself and then i lose the track of time how many hours i spent just researching something that was just interesting for me, and i never got tired of that, and if not my biological needs, like, to eat, to sleep, i know that i could research something forever. So, that side of me i usually call a passive learning, where you don't get those walls in your mind, that you Have to focus, that you have to concentrate, that you have to put away all the distractions, and the interest of learning something is just comes to you on itself. And if i push myself to learn something, i WILL have to push myself against the immediate mind response, that this work will be monotonous and exhausting.

I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive.

In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? \n\n\nThe curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.\n\nThink critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.']"

Some of my comments:\n1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can\'t efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren\'t ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.\n2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don\'t have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it\'s rather inefficient.\n3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!\n4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it\'s like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don\'t change as often.\n5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.\n\n\nMy resolutions:\n1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.

(So I don\'t have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what\'s going on in our field)\n7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I\'ve been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I\'ll be able to make it useful soon!\n\n\nThank you for an interesting and relatable video!', 'My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall.

With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.\n\n\nThe NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix.""]"

I know someone who hates that i do that to them, so i know its wrong. Tina has her struggles like anyone else I'm sure.\n\nI dont mean to ramble. I just need to reach out and tell the people who've found themselves here, like me, andnare blinded by the brilliance of this stunningly intelligent and motivated individual. Some of us are more emotional in nature, and I think there are careers or paths in life that dont involve being a corporate or business professional.

Crazy me, but I also took Simplilearn\'s Caltech AI and Machine Learning Bootcamp and still need to finish some projects. So, here I am, undisciplined and needing to complete those.  But because I did so well in those so far, I have a scholarship for IBM\'s Master of Masters program which I\'ve already joined and paid for.  Yet, I\'m going through Chris Haroun\'s Platinum MBA where I am actually making progress.  This ,while kicking myself and telling myself I really need to get back and complete the other stuff I started.  If that\'s not bad enough, I am also near completion of Geoffrey Hinton\'s Coursera which is considered outdated and sort of put on hold.  But I have close to perfect scores throughout that.\n\nMy wife and I have discussed this as a possible fear of success because 22 years ago, I was moving forward in my career when my ex got into an affair and broke up our marriage, and I sort of had a multi-year meltdown dealing with it as a single dad.  But I remarried in 2007.  My daughter is a software engineer a couple years older than you, and like you, she\'s doing very well.  She has a gorgeous home just north of the Oregon/Washington border which she uses partly as an AirBNB, and it seems to pay for itself.\n\nI\'m loving the MBA program.

I think this is quite the reason why this degree is so valuable. For people without a background, OMSCS provides a great opportunity for them and not like ""oh you dont have an undergrad in CS so you\'re never going to be able to get into a serious CS masters"". The program website already provided many guidance to those students about how to prepare for the prgram before the offical start of the first semester. It\'s the student\'s job to catch up. \n2) As you may already notice, the acceptance rate shows that the program opens doors for anyone looks serious. But whether they are going to really finish well on the program is another story. The low cost also attracts a lot of people who only want to know what CS is like but perhaps struggles with it and eventually find that CS is not for them. I will not be surprised that the job placement isn\'t ideal as compared to traditional on-campus and highly selective programs.', 'Just got accepted to this program! I‚Äôm still deciding whether I want to do this or a PhD in computational sciences', 'I finished the program. It\'s helped my career out, but as far as software engineering goes, I think it set me back. I could have been spending my time in class learning frameworks, system design, and how to write scalable code. About the videos, there are very few of them that are worthwhile to go back and watch. They skim over the topic and the real learning comes from the books, class message board, office hours, and coursework (which isn\'t made available publicly). I\'m grateful that I have the degree because now I have no trouble getting interviews and am considered for not only senior roles, but also lead, principal, and staff engineer roles. (I entered the program as a junior engineer who made a career change). I\'ve also come up on the radar of a few people interested in mentoring me toward a future CTO role. So go out there and get it because it\'s another credential that\'s going to help a stagnating career, but you\'re going to do your real learning (the kind employers care about) on your own time. The OMSCS is a signaling device for HR departments and as a way to differentiate yourself for HR departments who don\'t have the time or know-how to evaluate 100s of resumes peppered with qualified candidates and compete incompetents. It\'s to show intelligence, high conscientiousness, perseverance, and a tolerance for pain.\n\nAbout my background, my undergrad degree was in math, so I was able to figure out the CS stuff and found the calculus, linear algebra, probability doable. I think I was able to keep up math-wise and had to scramble to learn the fundamental CS concepts on the fly. If anything, it made things worse to learn everything by cramming. I need to go back someday and properly learn the fundamentals because now it\'s all just a blur. If you\'re coming from a non-CS or non-math/stats background, it\'s going to be tough. I don\'t know how much math and stats you learn in a finance or econ undergrad, for example. But don\'t let that stop you if you really want. You can always hire a tutor if you need to, or just attend every office hour and hound the TAs for help until you get up to speed. Just typing all this out is making me anxious! I feel lucky because I stood a chance with my math degree, but I really do feel for anybody else attempting this program without the background knowledge.\n\nAs for why the university lets anybody in, I\'ve seen on Reddit and Quora from people who are ""in the know"" that they\'re pretty openminded and willing to give people a chance, but they expect people to drop out. So there you go... just because you got in doesn\'t mean they\'re expecting you to finish. But you\'ll get the chance and maybe you\'ll pull through, self actualize, and express your true genius. They probably must figure that if they can uncover one long shot genius then that\'s worth the dozen others they let in who ultimately crash out. This is atypical because in most graduate programs, there\'s an unwritten ""non aggression principle"" whereby if you\'re let in, then the school will help you graduate because you\'ve ostensibly proven yourself worthy just by being admitted, and it\'s in everybody\'s best interest to see you graduate. In the OMSCS program, they\'ll let you in but the rest is up to you.', ""This is pretty helpful. Maybe some people applying don't realize exactly how much rigor they should really expect.

The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.\n\nI've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.\n\nAny suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?\n\nThat was long winded, but thanks!"", 'What made u switch Tina', 'Excellent talk between you two !

Sounds pedantic, but you don\'t ""enter"" the field as a Software Engineer and grow from there.  It\'s like saying a young person is a Brain Surgeon because they finished their first couple years of school and are doing internships in the medical field.  Software Engineer is the pinnacle, not the start.\n\nSimilarly, you might compare the scale to somebody learning Arithmetic versus somebody building complex geometrical rendering engines, or writing calculus equations to calculate rocket paths to other planets.  This is the difference between an entry level ""Developer"" or ""Coder"" versus an ""Engineer"".\n\nI am curious what the parallels are in Data Science.  Without using words describing seniority on a team (Junior, Senior, etc), what is the typical field of work an entry level person does versus the field of work somebody with 10-20 years of experience is doing?  Typically in development, people start by doing scripting, web development, or ""frontend"" development, and may move toward software development, MicroServices, ""backend"", and eventually ""Engineering"" which is more about principles and planning.

Maybe as a slightly more refined approach we should propose using the z score of the age instead- perhaps df[marks_normalised] = df[marks]*(1 +- df[age_zscore]) \n\nIn this way, people of average age have their score unadjusted, those below average age are nudged up or down, and those above average age and nudged down or up, depending on if you take the plus or minus\n\nThanks!""]"

Sure, ChatGPT builds great prototypes, but without a formal background in the topic, or proper understanding of the framework of the libraries that you\'re working with, you\'ll be in for an endless loop or garbage-in and garbage-out. Besides, you\'ll be in a bigger disaster if you\'re ever asked to present the code that you have ""written"" by walking through the implementation process. \n\nIn the question of whether ""formal education"" must be strictly a computer science degree; in my opinion, the answer is no. In any undergraduate discipline, you are expected to have a grasp of critical thinking. This means that you should know what questions to ask and what facts or observations to ignore (right, the BS detector). It would definitely be beneficial if you have taken at least some CS101 courses, ie knowing how the OOP paradigm works by heart is a good place to start, if not, then this is where continuous learning, either through self-taught or taking relevant courses, comes in. \n\nOn a related note, whenever you are self-learning, you accept the risk that you might follow a suboptimal course structure in exchange for the benefit of paying lower tuition costs. I think the best way to mitigate this risk is to critically examine the course syllabuses before starting the studies (and know that you have the prerequisites).

In a well tested course, the clues to do the homework are in the reading assignment. Keep re-reading until you find the clue or hint; this is likely to be a minor detail on first reading. If there are special cases, think like a computer programmer and how one would code them as ""IF"" statements.  In your certificate program, if hundreds of students have done it before you, the information you need to solve the problem should be in the lectures or reading. Don\'t be afraid to listen to the lecture twice and read four or five times (with breaks in between) and then for error messeges there is always Google. But, when you are doing your own independent project, there is no guarantee that the information you need is in the days readings and you do not have step by step instructions (unless you have written them yourself -- a good idea BTW). You have to decide what method to use because it is not necessarily given in an assignment. You gain an entirely different perspective.']"

I called it ‚ÄúRUVOL.‚Äù  \n\nOver time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the ‚ÄúNumber One Board Game in the World.‚Äù \n\nWhy am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become ‚Äúmemorizable.‚Äù  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents ‚Äúblindfolded.‚Äù  It‚Äôs for this reason I invented Ruvol where every game is always challenging and exciting to play.\n\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED?\n\nRuvol is played somewhat like chess. I purposely invented Ruvol to give chess a direct ‚Äúapple-to-apple‚Äù competition.  \n\nLike chess, Ruvol is played by two players.  It uses a board that is rectangular in shape but containing more number of squares than chess.  Like chess, it has equal number of pieces on each side of the board, where each type of piece moves in distinct ways.  However, if the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent‚Äôs king, the way to win Ruvol is to be able to cross a designated line.  \n\nBut there‚Äôs one biggest advantage Ruvol has over chess that makes Ruvol a very challenging game to play.  What is this?  Unlike chess, the Ruvol pieces are randomly placed at the start of every game which makes it impossible for any clever player to memorize the moves.  Fischer Random Chess, also known as Chess960, likewise introduced a random set up, but with many exceptions.  Ruvol is 100% random.\n\nAt present, there is no other board game in the world within the same category of chess ‚Äúwhere chess players can switch to.‚Äù  Chess is totally a monopoly in its class.  With the coming of Ruvol, chess has finally found its match!\n\nA MILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL IN RUVOL\n\nIn my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These 800 million players comprise the ‚ÄúTotal Potential Buyers‚Äù of Ruvol across the globe.  At an average profit of just US$3 per set, the ‚ÄúGlobal Income Potential‚Äù of Ruvol then is US$2.4 billion.  Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale of Ruvol is US$24M.\n\nI AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  \n\nFor the reason that I don‚Äôt have the resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it ‚Äúwiser‚Äù to simply sell my copyright.  \n\nIf you‚Äôre interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER‚Äî[the copyright goes to the most reasonable bid].  My email address is:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   [Or perhaps you can help me find a buyer, and I‚Äôll reward you with a commission.]\n\nThanks and God bless!\n \nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\nThe Ruvol Inventor\n\nEarly bird catches the worm!', 'Hi Keith great video.

I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform.

For example lets say you are running daily dates and want a count distinct by accounts etc. You will 100% not get the right count.

Ideally, your meat should be up to around the tomato's top and the cheese somewhat over it, so everything bakes nicely and the tomato doesn't get too dry. Then stuff it into a preheated oven and cook until all looks good to eat! Will probably take around 20 minutes depending on the oven's temperature and how big the tomatoes are.\n\nAnd the recipe can be adjusted however you want - take bigger tomatoes if you want to put more meat inside, or cover with a lot of cheese if that's your thing, or have a lot of small tomatoes if you're mostly in it for the veggies.

These models can be run locally, which is beneficial for those who don't want to send their information to OpenAI.\n\n3. The video demonstrates the use of H2O's GPT model, which can be run locally and can be fine-tuned to answer specific tasks. It also shows how to add external data sources to the model to improve its responses.\n\n4. The video mentions alternatives to H2O's GPT model, such as Local GPT and Private GPT. These alternatives are also popular and have their own advantages.\n\n5. The video demonstrates the use of LLM Studio, a tool that allows you to fine-tune models with your own dataset. It also allows you to chat with the chatbot you're training as it's training, so you can see if it answers your questions as expected.\n\n6. The video discusses the potential of open-source models to compete with GPT-3 and GPT-4. While currently, most open-source models are trying to compete with GPT-3, there's always time for them to catch up.\n\n7. The video also demonstrates how to use the chatbot to answer questions using external data sources. For example, it shows how to feed a website into the model so that it can use that information when trying to answer a question.\n\n8.

If a player\'s overall centipawn loss is 0 as an aggregate for the whole game, then the player played identically strong as stockfish, according to stockfish. In other words, stockfish evaluates a game to be ""perfect"" if the human player plays all the top engine moves  ... After each move played, stockfish evaluates a player\'s move in comparison to its top move.  So if the human plays the best move according to stockfish, the centipawn loss for that move is 0.  If the human did not play the best move, then stockfish assigns a certain centipawn loss to the move, correlating (but not exacting) to the value of the pieces on the board.  So if I blunder a pawn in an equal position, and a pawn is worth 1 to a human, then stockfish will assign a centipawn loss of 100 for that move.  If I blunder my queen like an idiot, which is worth 9 pawns theoretically, then stockfish will assign a centipawn loss of 900.  However, if I blunder my queen and it results in me getting checkmated next move, then stockfish will assign a centipawn loss of much more than 900.  Therefore, the centipawn loss is also evaluated based on how the move affects the game strategically, positionally, and/or tactically.

During the training process you always have the actual previous value (lag 1) but when you forecast into the unknown future even at the 2nd timestamp you already don't have the actual data for the lag1 for this unknown future, hence the trained parameter is not possible to be applied in this case during all the future steps, so everything less than the forecast horizon might be misleading in my opinion since the model will just not apply the trained relationship for those lags as they don't exists in each step.

It seems to me that Ray and Dask are intended to speed up data science operations for data sets that are vastly larger than any single computer could handle, all while allowing you to run your code from a single Jupyter Notebook. The problem those frameworks are intended to solve is that if your initial data set is, say, fifteen terabytes of RAM large, you're way past the point of using Pandas at all to analyze it on a single compute node. What Ray and Dask do is take the code from your Jupyter Notebook, break it down into jobs that can be executed on small chunks of the data set, schedule those to run on a compute node in a cluster, collect the results, then rinse-and-repeat until you have your final answer.

It is NOT that prisoners have 31.2% chance to be freed. 31.2% chance is for the map f:  Box Labels - -> Prisoner's #  to be good, in the sense that all cycle lengths of f <= 50. Only so, prisoner j can follow the loop strategy f(j), ff(j), ..., and  finally, f...f(j) = j. If all prisoners follow this strategy, then the group will succeed at the end. \n\nTherefore, the insight should be explained (in deterministic way ) in two parts, #1, the labeling function f must be good. #2, Given a good labeling function f, utilize the loop strategy. With both parts, all prisoners will be freed FOR SURE! \n\nIf the labeling function is bad, then things can be very ugly. For example, define f(j) = j + 1  for j < 100 and f(100) = 1.  Then f has a single cycle of length 100. For prisoner #1, f-composed-100-times (1) = 1. If he follows the loop strategy (he can only search 50 boxes), f-composed-k-times (1) <> 1 for k = 1, 2, ..., 50.  He and the entire group will be dead! In such a situation, the loop strategy is the worst, probability = zero.\n\nThe final point is:  the loop strategy works ONLY WHEN the labeling function f is good. The chance of f being good = 31.2%."", 'Absolutely beautiful!

John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16\r\n\r\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 \r\n\r\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8\r\n\r\nI am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9\r\n\r\nThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\r\n- Romans 10:9-11 KJV\r\n\r\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\r\n- Romans 10:13 KJV\r\n\r\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16\r\n\r\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 \r\n\r\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

IDF, instead captures the value of each term based on WHETHER it occurs in most documents or not. So even if the term occurs 1 million times in one document and never in other documents, its IDF value would be same as if the term occurs only 1 time in one document and never in other documents - since we are checking for number of docs that have term present & not how many times the term occurs. Hence, for my example, both the scenarios will assign the same high IDF value to the term.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]"

In the case of dragging a parcel box, the opposite side would be the distance between the box and the point where the rope is attached, and the hypotenuse would be the length of the rope.

So on whole what i mean is let us take an idea as a use case and implies various technologies on the same and give the real world use case as a package to the learner of the course. From learner's perspective, more than learning a technology, it will be like reading a story book, which will also walk him through the technologies as well encouraging him to think about helping the people of the world by addressing real world common problems of them.\n\nAnd I strongly possess learning technologies will do nothing unless we apply it to solve the problem of common people through it.

Hence, separated out the train and test datasets first, then applied the oversample/SMOTE technique on the training dataset only. Unfortunately, the precision, recall, and f1-score are not increasing for the minority class. This is quite logical though.
