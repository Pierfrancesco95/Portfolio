# API, JSON, NLP and SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - YOUTUBE

The goal of this project is to write a script in python language that is able to get data making requests to an API and using JSON files. So I imported this script in a Jupyter notebook to get a raw dataset, which I had to clean and explore before I could used it to make a Sentiment Analysis with Natural Languange Processing techniques to determine if the emotional tone of comments is positive, negative, or neutral.
