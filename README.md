For more details, in everyone you'll find a short summary which describes the aims and the work done. I hope this helps to show my technical skills and my passion about data, please feel free to contact me for any doubts.

## 1) SPREADSHEETS
###  01 Project: "Pivot tables and formulas: Global Superstore Dataset"

The goal of this project is to analyze the "Global Superstore" dataset using a spreadsheet. Starting from a series of questions, I arrived at the relative answers through the elaboration of pivot tables and/or the use of formulas (xlookup, sumifs, etc...).

## 2) SQL
###  01 Project: "Data exploration: European Soccer Database"

The goal of this project is to explore the "European Soccer" database writing SQL queries. First I built an E-R diagram to identify the relationship between tables, then I used Google Bigquery as data warehouse for the analysis.

## 3) PYTHON
###  01 Project: "Web Scraping, Data cleaning, Machine Learning: Price Prediction Real Estate Industry"
