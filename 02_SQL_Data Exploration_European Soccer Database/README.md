# DATA EXPLORATION - EUROPEAN SOCCER DATABASE

The goal of this project is to explore the "European Soccer" database (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer ) to get interesting information using queries written in SQL via Google Bigquery.

For the purposes of the project, some tables were used among those present in the original database, which were imported and analyzed in Google Bigquery.

After analyzing the structure of the Database and the tables, I built an E-R diagram to identify the relationship between them.

Once this was done and set a series of questions, I wrote the SQL queries to find the answers.

P.S. The work files have been attached in the "Documenti di lavoro" folder.
